This directory contains source for testing heuristics on the Multiple-\/\+Choice Multidimensional Knapsack problem (M\+M\+K\+P).

Supported problem instances are the legacy, 13 problem, Or-\/\+Lib library and the M\+M\+K\+P library of 370 problems by Hiremath and Hill. 

Heuristicâ€™s currently supported are\+: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Teaching-\/\+Learning Based optimization (T\+L\+B\+O) 
\item Artificial Bee Colony (A\+B\+C) 
\item Ant Colony Optimization (A\+C\+O) 
\item Criss-\/cross optimization(\+C\+O\+A) 
\item Binary Bat Algorithm (B\+B\+A) 
\item Genetic Algorithm (G\+A)
